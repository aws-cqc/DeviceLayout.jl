Basic Font Information

Noto is a global font collection for writing in all modern and ancient languages.
Noto Sans Mono is a monospaced, unmodulated (“sans serif”) design suitable for
programming code and other uses where a fixed-width font is needed. It supports
the Latin, Cyrillic and Greek scripts, and various symbols. It has multiple
weights and widths, and 3,787 glyphs. More information can be found at

PolyText Sans Mono is a modified version of Noto Sans Mono Regular that
represents characters as polygons without holes in the GDSII format.

12 October 2021 (Andrew Keller) PolyText Sans Mono version 1.0
- Noto Sans Mono Regular characters are mono-spaced in 100µm x 200µm boxes,
with cuts made to connect any interior islands within the characters to the
outside, and saved in GDSII format.
